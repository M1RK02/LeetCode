# LeetCode

## Description

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems that I worked on with my friend Daniele. It's a collection of coding challenges we tackled together, focusing on improving our problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
The solutions are written in Python, unknown to us till that moment, reflecting our collaborative learning process.
